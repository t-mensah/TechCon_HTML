            <p>
                Founded in 2010, TechCon began as a small gathering of tech enthusiasts in a local community center.
                It was born from a desire to create a platform for sharing knowledge and fostering innovation outside of large corporate settings.
                Over the years, TechCon has grown exponentially, attracting thousands of attendees and becoming a key event in the tech industry calendar.
                The event has moved from small meeting rooms to major convention centers, reflecting its expanding influence and community.
